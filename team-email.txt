Subject: New Landing Page Ready for Testing - simidoctor-calls.vercel.app

Hi Team,

Our new phone conversion landing page is live and ready for testing:

🔗 https://simidoctor-calls.vercel.app/

**What's on it:**
- November & December specials (Fillers, Cosmetic Injectables, Hair Restoration, Laser Treatments)
- Mobile-first design optimized for phone calls
- Sticky phone header: (805) 526-8360
- All tracking scripts installed (Google Analytics, Google Ads, Clarity, TikTok, Klaviyo)

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up CallRail account for call tracking (see CALLRAIL-SETUP-GUIDE.md)
2. Test the page on mobile and desktop
3. Once CallRail is configured, we can start sending test traffic

**For Email Campaigns:**
Use the short email template (email-short.txt) with the landing page URL.

Let me know if you see any issues or need changes.

Thanks!
